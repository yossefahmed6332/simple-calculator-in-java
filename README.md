# Simple Calculator in Java

This is a simple calculator program written in Java. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations and some mathematical functions using the Math library.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) – handles division by zero
- Power (`pow`) – calculates `x` raised to the power of `y`
- Optional functions on the result:
  - Square root (`sqr`)
  - Absolute value (`abs`)

## How to Use

1. Run the `Main.java` file in a Java-supported IDE or terminal.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `pow`).
4. Enter the second number.
5. Optionally, choose a function (`sqr` or `abs`) to apply to the result.
6. The program will display the final result.

## Example

hello! it is simple calculator you only add two numbers , please add first number

5
FN is: 5
now enter operation between + , - ,*,/
enter "pow" for power (x power y )
add your operation:
pow
enter second number
3
result: 125.0
do you want use absolute Value or square root ?
enter sqr to use square root enter abs to use absolute Value enter any value to refuse
sqr
result: 11.180339887498949
that's your last result: 11.180339887498949, thanks for use my calculator
